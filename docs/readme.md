This is the website for the iPad version of FTAnalyzer. It will shortly be available for initial early alpha testing via the TestFlight app.

If you are interested in being a tester please let me know by sending me a private message with your email address you use for your Apple ID. You can then download the [TestFlight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8) App from Apple's App Store.

I will tell Apple to allow your Apple ID account to test the app and that will then make the latest update appear in TestFlight. Clicking on the app icon in TestFlight will install a test version of the app from a secured part of the App Store onto your iPad.
