This is the website for the iPad version of FTAnalyzer. It will shortly be available for initial early alpha testing via the TestFlight app.

If you are interested in being a tester please let me know by sending me a private message with your email address you use for your Apple ID. I can then tell Apple to allow that account to test the app which is available in a special test part of the app store accessible via the [TestFlight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8) App from Apple.
